* After reviewing ST-LINK/V2-1 on Nucleo schematic and user guide, it appears that JP1 PWR_EXT (on PB3) should NOT be pulled up to 3V3, but rather should just be tied to GND. If high, it leaves USB power request at 100mA. If low, firmwawre asks PC for 300mA of USB current.
* Turns out that ST-LINK firmware always outputs 8MHz on PA8 (MCO). Maybe, for next rev, terminate with 10K resistor to ground to reduce RF spew?
