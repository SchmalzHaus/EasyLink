Version 4:
Designed to solder directly on to ST-Link-V3-Mini (you have to remove the 14 pin connector from the Mini first)

Has footprints for 14 pin edge connector, 14 pin SMD connector, and 6-pin EDT display board programming/debug connector

Version 5:
Renamed "Crossy Board" - Kraig's suggestion

Made smaller by:
* Removing 14 pin SMD connector, leaving only 14 pin edge connector as only connector
* Removing 6-pin EDT display board programming/debug connector
* Turning RESET and BOOT buttons 90 degrees
* Moving RTS/CTS/5V/GND pins 

This is as small as it's going to get
Built up 18 with ST-Link-V3s. 

Found one bug: (on both V4 and V5 crossy boards)
* BOOT pin pulls down to GND rather than up to 3.3V

(Reworked all V5 boards by cutting gnd thermals to BOOT pin (6 places), and running wire from target 3.3V to BOOT switch)

Version 6:
Exactly like V5 except BOOT pin now pulls up to target 3.3V
